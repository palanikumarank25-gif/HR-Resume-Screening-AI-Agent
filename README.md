## 🧩 Workflow Overview

High‑level flow:

1. **Resume Submitted / Collected**  
   - HR uploads candidate resume details into a **Google Sheet / Form**.

2. **Extract Resume Content**  
   - Node reads the resume text (name, email, phone, skills, experience).

3. **Resume Tidy / Normalisation**  
   - Cleans up the raw text for the AI model.

4. **Workflow Configuration**  
   - HR defines:
     - Target **Job Role**
     - Required **skills**
     - Min / Max **years of experience**
     - Other rules (must‑have keywords, etc.)

5. **AI Scoring – JD Match**  
   - LLM evaluates candidate vs JD.  
   - Returns structured JSON:
     - `matchScore` (0–100)
     - `matchReason`
     - extracted `skills`
     - `recommendation` (Shortlist / Reject)

6. **Decision Node – Shortlist Logic**  
   - If `matchScore` above threshold → **Shortlisted path**  
   - Else → **Rejected path**

7. **Store in Database / Sheet**  
   - Saves candidate record with:
     - `candidate_name`
     - `email`
     - `phone`
     - `years_of_experience`
     - `skills`
     - `matchScore`
     - `matchReason`
     - `status` (Shortlisted / Rejected)

8. **Send Emails**  
   - **Shortlisted Email**: congratulates candidate + next steps.  
   - **Rejected Email**: polite thanks + optional feedback.

## 🧠 AI Prompt Logic (Summary)

The AI model is prompted to:

1. Read candidate details (skills, experience, etc.).
2. Compare them with the job requirements.
3. Return **STRICT JSON** with:
   - `matchScore`
   - `matchReason`
   - `skills`
   - `recommendation`

This JSON is then parsed and used for decision‑making in n8n.
